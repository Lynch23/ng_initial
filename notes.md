## Angular Overview
Angular is a javascript framework that was introduced by Google to  develop single-page web applications.

### Single page v multipage application
A single page application is one that loads only a single web document and dynamically updates the body content of that single web page via javascript APIs such as fetch and XMLHttpRequest. This allows users to load new content/pages without loading whole new pages from the server. Single web applications enable client side rendering without refreshing the whole server.

A multi-page application does require a server refresh for every change such as submitting data, displaying new information etc. Data has to be
sent back to the server requesting a new web page from the server. This is a traditional approach in web application development.
